# [Archive] myottd (2007-09-25 -> RIP 2008-11-09)

***Archived for historical curiosity***, this is the original/monolithic prototype-in-production code for the late myottd.net service in 2007-2008.

See the [TT-Forums thread from 2007](https://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?t=34194) for more historical context.

See the [myottd2](https://github.com/SpComb/myottd2) repo for the major rewrite with a containerized microservice architecture from 2008 that never quite got finished...
